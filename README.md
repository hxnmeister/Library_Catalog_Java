Develop the Library Catalog application.
The library can store books, newspapers and almanacs (collections of works by several authors).

For a book, we must have the author of the book, the title of the book, the genre, the number of pages.
For a newspaper there must be the name of the newspaper, the date of publication of the newspaper issue, a list of the main headlines of the newspaper.
For an almanac there must be the name of the almanac and a list of works (books) that are published in it.

Develop an interface class with the necessary list of virtual abstract methods.

For the catalog, provide the possibility of test initialization, displaying the entire catalog on the screen, searching by book or newspaper title, searching by author.
